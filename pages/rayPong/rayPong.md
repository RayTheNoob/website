RayPong is a pong like game that can be played with one or two players. It features multiple scoring modes:

**Classic**
First player to get ten points wins

**3 Lives**
If you fail to block the puck, you lose a life. If you lose 3 lives, you lose.

**Unlimited**
There is no score kept

There are three modes for the bot you play against in single player

**Normal**
Self explanatory, this mode is normal

**Useless**
The bot is completely unable to play properly

**Unfair**
Bot uses a hacked client and plays without ethics
