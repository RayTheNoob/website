# Why I made this

For those who don't know, [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) is an awesome framework that you can make games with. I watched a quick tutorial on getting started with with LÖVE. I was then going to watch a tutorial on making a pong game but decided not to. Instead I made everything on my own and I think it worked out quite well, especially for my first finished game written in a text based language.
